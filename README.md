## Web applications course project assignment. My goal was to learn basic React so I just made a super barebones backend with a working React front end. 

## To run simply do the following steps:

1. `npm install`

2. `npm start`
Has been modified to build and deploy the project. It will first build the react front end to static files and then host the web applicaton with the node.js express server on localhost:8080.



## 
## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
